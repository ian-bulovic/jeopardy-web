# jeopardy-web

This is an old project that I have re-written and vastly improvedâ€”go check out https://github.com/ian-bulovic/jeopardy-ws

A simple Jeopardy app to host on your local network.

Run server.py and connect as many players as you want over your local network. Host can control buzzers and player scores, players can buzz in and see their own score.
